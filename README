Compiling

gcc -o asciirec asciirec.c
gcc -o asciiplay asciiplay.c

Usage

output | asciirec [args]
asciiplay file

Args

-filename <filename>	- output filename
-fps <fps>		- how many times per second to capture input.  
			  More captures will mean smoother playback, but 
			  might be too heavy for slower machines.
-maxfs <bytes>		- max size in bytes per frame.  Set this higher 
			  if your output is spitting out a LOT of text 
			  very fast.  Side effect: your terminal might 
			  not be able to output that much text for the 
			  duration of a frame.
